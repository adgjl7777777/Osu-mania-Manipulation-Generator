## Important things you should know
0. This program is the tool for users to make hard maps to manipulatable easy maps.
<br>You can convert .osu files.<br><br>
1. This program works in Windws 10. However, I couldn't test it in other OS.
<br>Therefore, this program might not work in other OS.<br><br>
2. If there is some errors, please check your .osu files.
<br>(1) The .osu file might have invalid contents.
<br>(2) The .osu file might have no bpm information.
<br>(3) You might typed invalid time.
<br>(4) You might typed overlapped time.<br>For example, Part 1 time : 0ms ~ 40000ms, and Part 2 time : 30000ms ~ 45000ms<br><br>
3. After generating, please check the map in Osu! editer with Ctrl+Shift+A to find whether notes are too close.<br><br>
